								Jenkins Installation in Redhat Linux
								====================================
Note: First of all, launch an Aws instance and connect using putty or Mobaexterm.
Also, along with ssh port 22, enable custom tcp port 8080 in security group while creating aws instance. 

Inside the terminal, execute the following commands :
-----------------------------------------------------
Note: In-order to use jenkins, we need to have Java in our system (i.e. aws instance)

// Java Installation
yum install java-1.8*       (yum command will be only for redhat server)

java -version
find / -name jre              # Copy the java path and paste in the .bash_profile
ls -la

// Setting the Java Path
vi .bash_profile
JAVA_Home=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.191.b12-1.el7_6.x86_64/jre
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME

Save and Quit from the vi editor.

echo $PATH   
/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
// Installing Jenkins
Note: Go to jenkins.io >> Downloads >> Choose Redhat OS >> Go through the documentation:
 Go to https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/
 
 yum install wget -y     # we need to install "wget" explicitly
 
 sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
 
 sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key
 
 yum install jenkins
 
 service jenkins status    # To check whether the jenkins is active or not (by default, jenkins will be in-active)
 
 service jenkins start     # Starting the jenkins service
 
 chkconfig jenkins on      # Whenever we stop and start the server, there are chances of not starting the jenkins
                             To overcome this issue, we need to give this command.  
 
 Next, go to Jenkins Server and copy the public ip. Then open any browser and enter in the url as below:
    Ex: http://13.233.50.130:8080/
	
Note: If we install Jenkins successfully then jenkins will start loading... 
 
 Jenkins page will open:  Initially, it will ask to enter the jenkins password.
 For this, 
 Go to terminal and check the passwd from the below path
 /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
 
 cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword    # We can see the admin password
 copy the password and go to jenkins home page paste the password.
 
 Note: After giving the password, system will ask to choose the plugins or install suggested plugins.
 But it is recommended to skip this step and directly click on "Start Jenkins"

 Welcome to Jenkins   # We will get the Jenkins Home Page / Dashboard
 
 Note: It is always recommended to change the Jenkins password. For this follow the below path:
       Go to Admin >>>> Choose configure & Change the password 
Next, 
 Logout and Login with new password
 
 username :Admin
 Password :.......
